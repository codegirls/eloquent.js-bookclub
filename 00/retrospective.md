# Retrospective #0

## What happened?

- introductions (two main "interests": graphic designers & learning js from the ground up, we plan to do the latter, hopefully cover/help with the former through exercises)
- short(ish) explanation of what we're trying to do (meet to discuss the book, enable to learn js further along the way)
- asked for questions
- went through the chapter
    - starting with the low-level examples, explaining what "memory locations" and "storing" something in them means
        - was a bit non-prepared for that (maybe it was "good" to see me confused as well?  don't know. :)
        - need slides/a projector, writing the code down makes for some awkward pauses
        - just standing in front was a bit weird as well, would prefer to do it while sitting
        - a few people discussed other/related things while i did the examples, not sure if that's because the examples were boring or because i took a while to write things down
    - it wasn't obvious that the code examples were all doing the same thing, mentioning that at the very beginning would help
    - in general, doing a recap of what the chapter does/says (or the part we're discussing) helps
    - the factorial "typographical conventions" example was a bit confusing, because we were getting way ahead of ourselves by working through it, not sure why that particular example was chosen

## What was missing?

- an "official" end
    - would have been/be a good place to mention homework & what to do/read for next time
- homework (didn't think of it, didn't plan ahead)
- forum (muut or something else?)
- asking for feedback again
- more tips from the notes
- mentioning the notes (probably put them on a simple site, or at least redirect <http://codegirls.de/eloquentjs> to the notes repo)

## For next time

- have a better plan of what to do
    - work through examples (which ones, look for potential questions/problems)
    - maybe start with a recap for last week, asking for remaining questions, if there was "homework" ask for questions regarding that
 - think about motivation and usages for the contents of the chapters (what to use numbers for, which numbers for what, ...; why do strings exist, strings vs variable names and keywords, ...)
