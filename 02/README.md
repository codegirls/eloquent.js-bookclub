# eloquent.js book club - session #2

(Chapter 2, Program Structure)

## Materials

- canvas and/or processing.js
    (we know loops know, let's do stuff!)

    - ideally, find a suitable tutorial
    - maybe recommend CodingMath?
- text adventure
    - maybe provide a "story outline" that we can already implement?
- *very* simple file processing w/ node.js

## Random

- Handmade Hero, see a game made from scratch, in C++.  maybe save that
    up for later, but i think it's a great (and important) project.
