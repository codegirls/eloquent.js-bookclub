# Retrospective #2

## What happened?

- walking through chapter 2, in order
    - the descriptions seemed to "make sense"
    - however, there weren't enough examples in the book,
        so the session was mostly providing small examples
        and tiny tasks and working out what they do

## What was missing?

- examples, lots of them
    - "explain what this code does" (explain)
    - "change this code to have this result" (modify)
    - "how would you do [similar] thing" (similar)
    - "how would you solve [x]" (solve)
        - most complicated, we didn't do much of this, because
            we didn't get to the excercises this time
- the structure was almost a bit dull this time, because we just
    went through the chapter, and it was mostly just "some stuff
    with numbers", nothing you would actually use.
    - need to ask whether it's clear what these are used for
    - or more importantly: provide examples where you would
        use something.  (maybe even point to a place in Real Codeâ„¢
        where it's used.)
- pointers to things to do.  (mentioned some in the preparations,
    but did not show them anyone.)  there's still a chance to do that,
    because i wanted to provide the manuscript, anyway.
    - related: canvas example
    - is there a good js playground for beginners?

## For next time

- provide "workalong" excercises
    - to ensure the material was understood, and to provide
        incentive/places for experimenting
    - maybe also provide "you should know how to do [x]"
        (or "... what [x] is" and "... how [x] works") type
        statements.
        - however, also make clear that it's ok to not know this,
            and that these situations are exactly the things we
            need to focus on in the session.  (i.e. these are the
            things to pose questions, or at least say that they
            were places with struggles.)
- related: provide notes in advance (including the excercises)
