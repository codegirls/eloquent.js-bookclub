# eloquent.js book club - session #3

(Chapter 2, Program Structure, part 2)

As always, you can send comments & questions to `info@codegirls.de`.

## Materials

- [the transcript](./transcript.html) with the solutions (and steps)
- [canvas.html](./canvas.html), download and edit this, then open it
    in your browser.  in particular, see what happens when you remove
    the comments around the second part of the code.

    Some resources related to the HTML Canvas API:

    - <http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html>
    - [No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/)
    - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial>

    While these may seem intimidating, please try playing around with
    the code.  Try changing some of the values in the example above,
    for example the colour, size of the rectangles that are drawn,
    and so on.  And then come back next time with lots of questions
