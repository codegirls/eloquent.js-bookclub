# Retrospective #3

## What happened?

- went through the exercises for chapter 2
- we had a whiteboard, which was *very* useful
- quite a few different solutions
- the last problem (chessboard), was the most difficult one

## What was missing?

- "live" transcript (because of the whiteboard)
    - also, for some the whiteboard was too far way
- correct solutions (we didn't verify all of them)

## For next time

- have *some* kind of whiteboard again
    - maybe something online, but not sure at all
- more exercises (in addition to the ones in the book)
    - both as backup (if we're too fast) and as additional
      practice
- no (or very reduced) repeating of the content of the book,
    the exercises (and our additional ones) will show if there
    are problems, and which ones.
    - of course, questions are still essential
